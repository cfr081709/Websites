            <h1>Rock Paper Scissors Site</h1>
            <h4>The rock, paper, scissors site is a bit of simpler one. It incorporates JS, HTML, and CSS. I used CSS to design the boxes and header with clashing vibrant colors. The HTML was used to add text and elements. Finally the JS was used to keep track of wins and losses, report back and win or loss, compare values, and randomize the computers choice. This project took me just under around 2 hours. This project though simple is one of my favorite.</h4>

            <h4>The Bible Site was a project I was very passionate about. As a catholic I like to think of myself as a very faithful person. At the time of making this site St. Carlos Acutis was just being cannonized and he is the one who inspired me to make the site. The site is once again very simple consisting of just JS, CSS, and HTML. You hit a button made with HTML and generate a qoute, act of mercy, or prayer listed in JS.</h4>

You manually input data yourself and are then presented with the statistics. You get %, if you went negative you get a warning.
